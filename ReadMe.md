# Web-Scraping project
## Introduction 
This document will describe what each Task does and how it works. 
The tools that was used to do each task is:
Python 2.7.3
Mechanize 
BeautifullSoup 
    
These toole were used to fetch website pages over HTTP and parsing the resulting HTML.
    
In each task I tried to adhere to PEP 8 standards and I tried to build each task as readable as possible and have  commented before every line of program code that explaines that line.
  
## Task A - Aggregate news headlines
Is a Python script that takes the Username and Password for a slashdot.org account. Mechanize and BeautifullSoup was used to log into http://slashdot.org/ through the use of the credetials the user has provided. when the login process fails then it gets handled and the user sould retry logging in. So when the login process was successful then this script will ask the user to input a timestams and then the script will then run through the page and then it get all the headlines, authors and output the result after the results has been outputed then it will follow the older link and then
